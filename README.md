PRpal is a tool that enforces peer review by requiring the assignee
of your pull request to give a +1.

## How it Works

It's simple: PRpal ensures that the assignee of your pull request has commented with a +1 (or the
+1 emoji). It enforces this rule by using the GitHub Status API.

## Deploy to Heroku
